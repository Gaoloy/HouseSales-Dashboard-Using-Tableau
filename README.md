This report was created with data from 2014 and 2015 house sale in the Washington area.

This project will help prospective buyers to have a knowledge of the median price of house in the Washington state area as it relates to the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, the view, condition of the building year built, square foot living and square foot lot of the building. 

Selecting the different month filters all of the visuals but selecting specific dates only filters the bottom four charts.
